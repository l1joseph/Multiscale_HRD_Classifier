# Multiscale_HRD_Classifier

Abstract:
Breast cancers are characterized by mutations in BRCA1/2 genes that are involved in
maintaining genomic stability. BRCA deficient cells are known to harbor Homologous
Recombination Deficiency (HRD), which is a dysregulation of a double stranded DNA repair
pathway called Homologous Recombination (HR). Patients harboring HRD are sensitive to
PARP inhibition and chemo therapies. Recent literature has shown that specific subsets of
biomarkers characterize HRD breast cancer patients. Using 857 breast cancer patients from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) we trained softHRD, a machine learning approach for detecting
HRD in breast cancer via a transcriptional signature. By validating our model on PARPi clinical
trials, we are able to demonstrate the utility of our model at not only predicting the HRD status
of breast cancer patients, but also the ability to provide a clinically relevant transcriptional
signature of genomic instability.

Executive Summary
* HRD is highly correlated with Breast cancer
* PARPi treatments provide the most precise treatment for BRCA deficient HRD patients
* Current advances in Machine learning methods and the advent of Next Generation
Sequencing allows for the ability of precise real time classification of HRD in breast
cancer patients
* The Goal of this project is to develop a machine learning approach to classify HRD in
breast cancer patients while providing a clinically relevant transcriptional signature
* In the future we hope to validate our model on many more clinical datasets to improve
the utility of our signature
* We also want to expand to a pan-cancer signature
